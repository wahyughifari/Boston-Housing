# Boston House Price Prediction App

This project focuses on building an interactive web application to predict median house prices in the Boston area using a Ridge Regression model. The app was developed using Streamlit and integrates both Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and real-time machine learning predictions.

## Problem Statement

Housing price prediction is a critical task for real estate buyers, sellers, and investors to make informed decisions. Accurate estimation of house prices based on key property features can help stakeholders evaluate market value, set realistic prices, and identify investment opportunities. However, housing markets are complex and influenced by various factors, making price prediction challenging.

## Objective

This project aims to develop an interactive web application that:

- Enables **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Boston Housing dataset to understand feature distributions, correlations, and their relationships with house prices.
- Provides a **predictive model** using Ridge Regression to estimate median house prices based on user-input property features.
- Offers an intuitive user interface for both data exploration and price prediction to support data-driven decision-making.

## Features

- Visualization of target variable distribution and feature correlations  
- Scatterplots and boxplots to explore relationships between key features and house prices  
- Interactive sidebar inputs for users to specify property attributes  
- Real-time house price prediction with a trained Ridge Regression model  
- Display of dataset summary statistics for better understanding of data characteristics  

## Dataset

The application uses the well-known **Boston Housing dataset**, which contains information about various features of houses in Boston suburbs and their median values.
